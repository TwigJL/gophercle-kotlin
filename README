gophercle - minimalist gopher client for android
================================================
gophercle lets you access the gopherspace in a very efficient, resource-friendly way.

this is a fork of https://gitlab.com/biotstoiq/gophercle, all credit goes to him
there most probably won't be any new features/improvements because I don't know Java
this repo exists because I wanted to use #ff000000 black backround instead of grey one
